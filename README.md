# TimeSeriesAirTraffic

Time-series analysis of the air traffic on three European countries (Spain, Germany and Italy). 

Our intention was to obtain highly-interpretable models to explain the dynamics of the air traffic on each country based on different explanatory variables such as the economic activity, the price fluctuations, the competition/interaction with the railway traffic, etc. The analysis, involved dealing with some aspects that are inherent to time-series such as seasonality and autocorrelation. 
Because of our interpretability focus, we used time-series linear regressions and a dynamic regressions with ARIMA errors instead of more complex or opaque alternatives. Our approach was effective in achieving well-fitting and understandable models.

This project was part of the [Time-Series Analysis for Business, Economic and Financial Data](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2022/LM/SC/SC2377/002PD/SCQ0093723/N0) course of my master's degree.
